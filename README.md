My first time using an API! 

This project was really cool because it opened my mind to the possibilities when utilizing APIs and working with large amounts of data.

While not the prettiest (yet), this project is a running list of all the known Pokemon using PokeAPI. I also added numbering so with each new Pokemon, they will be added to the list and given the next sequential number.

I would love to make this more interactive and interesting visually. I could make it look like a Pokedex and instead of listing them all on one page they could be in more of a slideshow/carousel on the Pokedex screen. 

That's a bit more than I can chew at the moment though. A realistic next step would be to figure out how to add all their names as well as the numbers.
